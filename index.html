                  HOW IT IS PLAYED?<br />
                  Each team is presented with a group of puzzles, or clues,
                  which teams must solve in order to find a piece of
                  information. Each clue leads to a location within walking
                  distance, where players must find and use a vital piece of
                  information to answer a question. This information could be
                  words from a historical plaque, a series of numbers or an
                  address, a landmark, or any other unique item. This is a one
                  day event, consisting of 6 teams having 5 members each
                  competing for a treasure.

                  information. Each clue leads to a location within walking
